# RSA-Assignment
RSA assignment in cryptography college course

# How to run the program

## Lets begin by the chat app
1- open a terminal and split it into 2
2- run the sender first in one terminal using the command --> python sender.py
3- run the receiver in the other terminal using the command --> python receiver.py
4- start chatting between them
5- you will see that messages are sent, encrypted then decrypted at the other side

## Breaking the RSA program
1- open the jupyter notebook <attack_pipeline.ipynb>
2- run all the cells
3- wait until the graph of the time VS n_bits size appears
4- hint --> if you change any code in the RSA.py, then you need to restart the notebook to see your changes

## Analyze the speed of the Encryption and Decryption
1- open the jupyter notebook <enc_dec_diff_n.ipynb>
2- run all the cells
3- wait until the 2 graphs of the time VS n_bits size appear
